abstract = {Using analogies with electromagnetic radiation, we present a calculation of the properties of gravitational radiation emitted by orbiting binary objects. The calculation produces results that have the same dependence on the masses of the orbiting objects, the orbital frequency, and the mass separation as do the results from the linear version of general relativity (GR). However, the calculation yields polarization, angular distributions, and overall power results that differ from those of GR. Nevertheless, the calculation produces waveforms that are very similar to those observed by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO-VIRGO) gravitational wave collaboration in 2015 up to the point at which the binary merger occurs. The details of the calculation should be understandable by upper-level physics students and physicists who are not experts in GR.},

abstract = {Binary black hole mergers are analyzed using concepts from introductory physics. Drawing upon Newtonian mechanics, dimensional considerations, and analogies between gravitational and electromagnetic waves, we are able to explain the principal features of LIGO's data and make order of magnitude estimates of key parameters of the event by inspection of the data. Our estimates of the black hole masses, the distance to the event, the initial separation of the pair, and the stupendous total amount of energy radiated are all in good agreement with the best fit values of these parameters obtained by the LIGO-VIRGO collaboration.},

@article{Ugolini2019,
abstract = {The first direct detection of gravitational waves by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) in September 2015 proved their existence, as predicted by Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, and ushered in the era of gravitational-wave interferometry. In this article, we present a set of lab course experiments at different levels of advancement, which give students insight into the basic LIGO operating principle and advanced detection techniques. Starting with methods for folding an optical cavity, we advance to analogy experiments with sound waves that can be detected with a Michelson interferometer with an optical cavity arm. In that experiment, students also learn how the sensitivity of the device can be tuned. In a last step, we show how optical heterodyne detection (the mixing of a signal with a reference oscillator) was used in Initial LIGO. We hope these experiments not only give students an understanding of some LIGO techniques but also awaken a fascination for how unimagin...},
